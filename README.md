Welcome to the **Questionnaire project**, also known as the **Accordion Project**. In this project, we will create a list of questions where clicking on a plus button reveals the corresponding answer and changes the button state. This functionality is commonly seen in accordion-style layouts, which you may have used as a user. The project will include three questions, and each time a button is clicked, the associated answer will toggle its visibility along with the button's rendering. Let's learn how to build this setup ourselves!
